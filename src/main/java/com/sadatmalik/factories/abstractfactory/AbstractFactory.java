/**
 * The Abstract Factory pattern has not one but several factory methods.
 * Each of the factory methods creates a different kind of object.
 *
 * The idea is that at the point of creation of the factory object, you
 * decide how all the objects created by that factory will be used.
 *
 * The example given in Design Patterns implements portability across
 * various graphical user interfaces (GUIs): you create a factory object
 * appropriate to the GUI that youâ€™re working with, and from then on when
 * you ask it for a menu, button, slider, etc. it will automatically create
 * the appropriate version of that item for the GUI.
 *
 * This example suppose you are creating a general-purpose gaming
 * environment, and you want to be able to support different types of
 * games.
